        Online shopping explantion and examples Online shopping is a form of
        electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or
        services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile

        An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or
        services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center;
        the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When
        an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another
        businesses, the process is called business-to-business (B2B) online
        shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the
        firm's range of products and services, view photos or images of the
        products, along with information about the product specifications,
        features and prices.
